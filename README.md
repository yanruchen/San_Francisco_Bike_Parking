# San Francisco Bike Parking Facilities
Analysis and visualization of San Francisco bike parking facilities. I used R to wrangle the dataset and find the information I am interested in, then made visualizations on the map.

Selective work of what's in the code:
1. Filter the data of interest, and visualiza on the map. ![filter](filter.png)
2. Sort the data and visualize the stations by the number of spaces. ![bar](bar.png)
3. Mark a location on the map. ![label](label.png)
